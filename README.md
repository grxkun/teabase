# teabase
**Project Idea:** “TeaBase” - A Decentralized Dependency Management System
**Overview:**
TeaBase aims to revolutionize how developers manage dependencies in their projects. It provides a decentralized, trustless, and efficient way to handle software dependencies, ensuring stability, security, and transparency.

**Features:**
Decentralized Registry:
TeaBase maintains a decentralized registry of all open-source packages.
Developers can publish, update, and query package information directly on the blockchain.
Immutable Package Versions:
Each package version is cryptographically signed and stored on-chain.
Once published, a version cannot be altered, ensuring immutability.
Dependency Graphs:
TeaBase constructs dependency graphs for projects.
Developers can visualize and analyze their project’s dependencies.
Proof of Contribution (PoC):
TeaBase calculates a project’s teaRank based on its impact within the ecosystem.
High-ranking projects receive more attention and rewards.
Smart Contract Integration:
TeaBase integrates with Ethereum smart contracts for package management.
Developers can interact with the registry using Web3 libraries.
Implementation Steps:
Smart Contracts:
Develop Ethereum smart contracts for package registration, version management, and querying.
Implement PoC logic to calculate teaRank.
CLI Tool:
Create a command-line interface (CLI) tool for developers to interact with TeaBase.
Commands: tea init, tea publish, tea install, tea graph, etc.
Web Interface:
Build a web interface for browsing and searching packages.
Display package details, versions, and dependencies.
IPFS Integration:
Use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store package metadata and files.
Hashes of IPFS content can be stored on-chain.
Documentation and Tutorials:
Write comprehensive documentation explaining TeaBase’s architecture, usage, and integration.
Provide tutorials for developers to get started.
Tech Stack:
Solidity: For smart contract development.
Node.js: For CLI tool and web interface.
IPFS: For decentralized file storage.
Web3.js: For Ethereum interaction.
Benefits:
Trustless: No central authority; everything is verifiable on the blockchain.
Incentivized Maintenance: Developers earn rewards for maintaining packages.
Transparent: Dependency information is public and auditable.
